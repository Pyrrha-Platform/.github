[Prometeo Solutions S.L.](https://prometeoplatform.com/) created **_Prometeo_** as a [Call for Code submission](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/solutions/prometeo/) that won the top prize in the Global Challenge. In 2021, **_Pyrrha_** was contributed to the Linux Foundation as the open source core of Prometeo in order share the technology and provide a way for others to improve it for the benefit of all.

[The Pyrrha mission](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha/blob/main/Pyrrha-Technical-Charter-July-2021.pdf) is to help protect firefighters from the immediate and long-term health impacts from the smoke and toxins they inhale by providing real-time information on exposure and by calculating longer-term averages. The project uses custom sensors, smartphone and smartwatch apps, data science, and a dashboard to provide decision-making insight and information.

Improved by field tests in the Catalonia region of Spain and through the support of IBM Service Corps volunteers, our hope is that Pyrrha can also provide a powerful solution to assist wildlands firefighting teams around the world in their battle against more frequent and more devastating wildfires and bushfires.
